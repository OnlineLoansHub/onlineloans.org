          <h2 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-0">What Is a Debt Consolidation?</h2>
          <p>Debt Consolidations provide you with a lump sum of cash that you can use for almost any purpose. These
            loans are typically unsecured, meaning you don’t need collateral to get one. Instead, lenders
            will review your income, debts, and credit profile to determine whether they can offer you a
            loan.</p>
          <p>Terms on Debt Consolidations can vary widely. Depending on the lender and your financial
            circumstances, <strong>you can get a loan for as little as $1,000 or as much as
              $100,000.</strong>&nbsp;Interest rates range from 6% to 35.99%. Loan terms vary but are
            usually between 12 and 60 months.</p>
          <p>Unlike other types of loans, like mortgages or business loans, Debt Consolidations offer the
            flexibility of using funds on almost anything. That includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Home improvement or repairs</li>
            <li>Medical debt</li>
            <li>Sudden expenses, like funerals or fires</li>
            <li>Debt consolidation</li>
            <li>Small business costs</li>
            <li>Major life events</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>You can get the funds from Debt Consolidations faster than other types of
              loans.</strong>&nbsp;Lenders typically deposit funds within a few days of approval. Once the
            money arrives in your bank account, you’ll start repaying within 30 days. You’ll have a set
            monthly bill for the term of the loan, though you may pay it off faster if you choose to make
            additional payments.</p>

          <h2 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-1">Types of Debt Consolidations</h2>
          <p>There are several types of Debt Consolidations to choose from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Unsecured:</strong>&nbsp;An unsecured loan doesn’t have any collateral to back it,
              which usually means it has a higher interest rate compared to a secured loan. It can also be
              more difficult to get an unsecured loan as lenders require better financial circumstances to
              qualify.</li>
            <li><strong>Secured:</strong>&nbsp;This type of loan has collateral, like a car or other
              valuable item, to back it. If you fail to repay the loan, your lender will use the
              collateral to recoup their lost funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosigned:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re struggling to get a Debt Consolidation due to poor
              credit or finances, a cosigner could help. The cosigner, which could be a family member or
              friend, agrees to repay the loan if you cannot.</li>
            <li><strong>Variable and fixed rate loans:</strong>&nbsp;All loans have either fixed or variable
              interest rates. With a fixed rate, you pay the same interest rate over the life of the loan.
              With variable rates, your interest rate fluctuates with the market.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-2">When to Get a Debt Consolidation</h2>
          <p>Since Debt Consolidations are typically unsecured, they can sometimes be more expensive than other
            types of loans. That said, there are times when getting a Debt Consolidation can make the most sense.
          </p>
          <p><strong>It’s best to get this type of loan when it is the least expensive form of
              financing.</strong>&nbsp;For example, let’s say you want to open a small business and get a
            few quotes for a business loan. If those loans have higher interest rates than a Debt Consolidation,
            then it makes more sense to choose the Debt Consolidation.</p>
          <p>You’ll also need to make sure you can afford the monthly payments. That means the payment fits
            into your budget without having to cut down on your essential spending, like groceries or
            utilities.</p>
          <p>Additionally, it can make sense to get a Debt Consolidation when it will improve your financial
            circumstances. <strong>For example, using a Debt Consolidation to improve your house can add value to
              your home and allow you to make more when you sell it. </strong></p>
          <p>Debt Consolidations can also help you consolidate debt, which could greatly improve your finances.
            Credit card debt can have high interest rates – up to 35.99%. If you carry a balance, that debt
            multiplies and can be impossible to pay off. Getting a Debt Consolidation allows you to pay it all
            off immediately and have a new set monthly payment that fits into your budget.</p>

          <h2 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-3">How to Get the Best Debt Consolidations</h2>
          <p>Generally speaking, the best Debt Consolidations are those that have <strong>the lowest APRs, minimal
              fees, and monthly payments you can comfortably afford.</strong>&nbsp;Since most personal
            loans are unsecured, your loan terms depend largely on your personal finances.</p>
          <p><strong>To get the best Debt Consolidation, you’ll need a strong credit score.</strong>&nbsp;You can
            boost your credit by reviewing your history. Request your credit report from the three major
            credit reporting companies: TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. Then, you can review your reports
            for any errors that could be lowering your credit score.</p>
          <p><strong>At the same time, try to pay down any outstanding debts if you can, like credit
              cards.</strong>&nbsp;This will improve your DTI (debt-to-income) ratio, which makes you a
            less risky investment for Debt Consolidation lenders.</p>

              Consolidation Quote

          <h2 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-4">How to Apply for a Debt Consolidation</h2>
          <p>Applying for a Debt Consolidation is easy, though it’s important to spend time doing your research.
            There are just a few steps to complete.</p>
          <h3 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-5">1. Shop Around</h3>
          <p>Loan terms can vary greatly from lender to lender, so it’s important to <strong>compare your
              options before applying. </strong>You can use the table above to compare the pros and cons
            of the top lenders.</p>
          <p><strong>Once you have 3 to 5 lenders in mind, prequalify with each. </strong>This step allows you
            to get personalized rate estimates and terms so you can get a good idea of your loan options.
            Many lenders allow you to prequalify with just a soft credit pull, meaning you won’t affect your
            credit score.</p>
          <p>Compare your prequalified&nbsp;offers to determine which is the best fit for you. Generally
            speaking, the offer with the lowest APR and monthly payments is usually best as it will save you
            the most money and fit into your budget best.</p>
          <h3 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-6">2. Submit an Application</h3>
          <p>Once you’ve selected a lender, submit a full application.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Applying for a
            loan requires you to provide documentation about your identity and income, like W2s and pay
            stubs. As long as you have the documents ready, <strong>it should take under 30 minutes to
              complete this step.</strong></p>
          <h3 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-7">3. Receive Your Funds and Start Repayment</h3>
          <p>Most lenders take two to five days to approve your loan and deliver your funds. That said, some
            of the best Debt Consolidation lenders can approve you and deliver your money <strong>in just one
              working day. </strong></p>
          <p>You’ll typically start repaying the loan within a month of receiving the funds. Many lenders
            allow you to set up autopay so you never miss a bill. Be sure to make full, on-time payments
            each month to protect your credit score and meet the terms of your loan.</p>

          <h2 class="article-paragraph" id="nav-8">Choosing the Best Lender</h2>
          <p>The cost of your loan will be the most important factor of your Debt Consolidation. However, it’s also
            key to consider your lender. You’ll have to interact with it for months or years as you repay
            the loan, so be sure to compare options.</p>
          <p>To get the best Debt Consolidations, consider doing the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Shop around and research:</strong>&nbsp;Don’t just take the first Debt Consolidation you
              come across. Compare rates, terms, fees, repayment options, and customer service channels to
              determine which is best for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for customer reviews:</strong>&nbsp;What are other people saying about your
              chosen lender? If it has a bad reputation, you might want to avoid it. Scan third-party
              sites, like Google and TrustPilot, for unbiased reviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for hidden costs: </strong>A lender may charge you origination, processing,
              late, and early repayment fees. Read the fine print to make sure you understand all the
              costs associated with your loan. The best Debt Consolidations have minimal fees. Your lender will
              be able to explain each fee to you, so don’t be afraid to ask.</li>

          <p>Loans made by First Electronic Bank, member FDIC. Loans over 35.99% APR. Your actual rate
            depends upon proprietary scoring, credit history, and payment schedule. Loan approval not
            guaranteed. Loans range from $500 to $2,500.
            For loans made by First Electronic Bank, acceptable payment methods include ACH, debit card,
            personal check, money order, and cashier’s check. Cash not accepted.
            See Terms & Conditions for website terms of use and other important disclosures.
            Applications approved before 10:30 a.m. CT Monday-Friday are generally funded the same
            business day. Applications approved after this time are generally funded the next business day.
            Some applications may require additional verification, in which case the loan, if approved, will be
            funded the business day after such additional verification is completed.
            Loans above 35.99% APR are not recommended as long-term financial solutions. Your choice of a
            loan product should match your needs and ability to repay. Consider carefully the amount, term,
            and finance charges for any loan. If you choose a high interest loan, reduce your finance charges
            by paying more than the minimum installment payment. Paying late increases your finance
            charges and may cause you to incur a late fee. Customers with credit difficulties should seek
            consumer credit counseling. For helpful resources concerning financial literacy, credit score
            trends, and a glossary of financial terms, please see the Resources tab at the top of our website,
